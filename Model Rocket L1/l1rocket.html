                <p class="process"><br>A high-powered rocket was built to 
                achieve level 1 certification, capable of securely reaching an
                altitude of 2728 feet with an H-class motor. The fin assembly was
                made out of laser-cut birch wood, the nosecone was 3D printed,
                and a cardboard body tube was used, all simulated in OpenRocket
                and modeled in OnShape. The rocket flew on April 6, 2024
                only to be lost in a cloud. Due to it going missing, an
                identical rocket was made using new techniques. It flew
                on April 21, 2024 where it ascended smoothly off the path, 
                performed a stable ascent, deployed the parachute at 300 feet,
                and returned safely to ground.</p>
                <p class="process">The fin assembly was laser cut into centering
                rings and 4 fins, with the top and bottom centering rings
                cut out of 1/4" birch plywood and the rest out of 1/8" birch.
                They were then epoxied together and sanded to a smooth finish.
                To prepare the body tube, fin slots were cut using a table saw
                and the fin assembly was later epoxied into the slots. A
                parachute was installed, the nosecone was fitted, the motor
                was fit-checked, and the rocket was painted.
