                <p class="process"><br>A 100-person construction was planned
                culminating in the building of 10 wooden houses in the
                marginalized communities of Mesas Coloradas, Zapopan, Mexico. The
                build took place over three days during which each leader was
                assigned several groups of 10 people, each group corresponding to
                a house to monitor and assist during the process. All volunteers
                spent three days and nights in the community with reflection
                activities carried out at night and post-construction. Throughout
                the construction, volunteers gained insight and experienced the 
                lifestyle in these marginalized communities.</p>
                <p class="process">The planning phase included making trips to
                the community to assess household terrains, gain insight into the
                community and families' needs, carry out interviews and paperwork,
                and fundraise enough money to cover the costs of the build. After
                the construction, periodic checks on the houses were carried out
                to ensure the houses were in proper condition. Food and toys
                were donated to the families and construction activities were
                carried out with the families to involve them in the process.</p>
